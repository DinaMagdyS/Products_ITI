Just started learning HTML and CSS as part of my curriculum in the 4-month Intensive Code Camp Scholarship at the Information Technology Institute (ITI) where I am specializing in the software testing track. As I transition from a career in pharmacy to software testing and embark on this journey into web development, I am aware that these are just my initial steps. This project represents my growing understanding and application of these fundamental technologies. While there is still much to learn, I am eager to continue expanding my skills and knowledge. Each new challenge presents an opportunity for growth, and I look forward to diving in this new thrilling world.
